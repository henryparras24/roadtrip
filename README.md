# Roadtrip

## Description
This weeks goal is to design a web page that uses two Api's successfully. We want to design a web page that will address and solve a problem for our targeted audience.

## User Story
Our user is anyone who is taking a road trip and doesn't want to go thru the trouble of using multiple apps. We want to make it easier for the user to find common services for whatever city that they are travelling to. We also want to give our user music options for their trip. Our goal is to make it easier for the user entering a destination and the services are provided on one page along with a music playlist if they choose. 

## Directions
For this project we want to use two Api's and use them on our webpage successfully.

## Instructions (incase we want to put this on the wp for our users)

## Acceptance Criteria 
Given when the user enters a destination then the cards populate with resteraunts, hotels, coffe and gas stations. Then when the user goes to select a music genre and a playlist is generated from their selection.
