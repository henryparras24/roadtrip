# Roadtrip

## Description
This weeks goal is to design a web page that uses two Api's successfully. We want to design a web page that will address and solve a problem for our targeted audience.

## User Story
Our user is anyone who is taking a road trip and doesn't want to go thru the trouble of using multiple apps thus providing a more enjoyable roadtrip experience. We want to make it easier for the user to find common services for whatever city that they are travelling to. We also want to give our user music options for their trip. 

## Directions
For this project we want to use two Api's and use them on our webpage successfully.

## Instructions
When page loads the user should type in a city so that hotels, coffee, resteraunts and gas stations will appear on the cards. Once the services are displayed the user can click on the service they want in whatever category and the website page to the service will open in another window. There is also a widget towards the bottom of the page on the left hand side so the user can play music for a more enjoyable roadtrip[.]

## Acceptance Criteria 
Given when the user enters a destination then the cards populate with resteraunts, hotels, coffe and gas stations. 
Given when the user goes to select a service in any category and in a new window they are provided with the yelp page for the service
Given when the user goes to select music 
And music is played.

## Mockup
This is what our webpage looks like
